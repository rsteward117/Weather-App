# City Weather App

## Description:

This app reports the daily weather of a city/location the user enters. After the user has inputed their target location the App will fetch the relevant data from the OpenWeatherMap.org API(https://openweathermap.org/api). Then display the data on the page.

For this app I used the following techologies.

* React
* Javascript
* CSS
* Html/JSX

My reasoning for using these technologies more specific react. Was to take advantage of react's useState hooks to store and move data, also to use react-spinner to add a loading spinner, so user can have feedback that their data is currently being retrieved from the API.

## How To Use

The App is very simple once It loads You will see a Search Bar with text that say "Enter City Here" Enter the Nmae of the city or what ever location your currently at, or a location that you would like to know what the weather is like. Then click the button with the search icon next to the search bar, and your done. When the wether info is displayed on the page you can click the button next to the temperature with the letter "C" to toggle the temperatureS between fahrenheit and celsius.

## Conclusion

This was a very fun and practical App to work and use. I'am gald that I got a chance to use many of skills I gathered learning frontend web developent to build this App from the ground up.
